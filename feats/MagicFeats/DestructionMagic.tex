	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character can learn Advanced-level Destruction Magic spells, and gets a \Bonus{10\%} to the effectiveness of their Basic-Destruction Destruction Magic spells. The character also gains a bonus Advanced-level Destruction Magic spell of their chosing. For Destruction Magic spells that also belong to one of the schools of Elemental Magic, this bonus also stacks up with the feat relevant to the corresponding element.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character can learn Expert-level Destruction Magic spells, and gets a \Bonus{30\%} to the effectiveness of their Basic-tier Destruction Magic spells and \Bonus{15\%} to the effectiveness of their Advanced-tier Destruction Magic spells.
