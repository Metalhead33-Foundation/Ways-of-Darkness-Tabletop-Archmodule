\FeatI{Magica Divinitatis}{{\import{images/Feats/}{images/Feats/Clericalism.pdf_tex}}}
\end{table}
\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Trained:} Character must not have the feat \textbf{Magica Profana} or \textbf{Magica Naturae} in order to take up this feat. Additionally, in a serious and realistic tabletop setting - where no one can just learn magic overnight - it should be up to the GM's discression to decide whether characters who didn't already have this feat in the first place should be allowed to take it up during an adventure \textit{(and even so, only religious characters should be allowed to take this up)}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character cannot use Clerical Magic.
	\item \textbf{Trained:} The character can use Clerical Magic, and can learn spells and other magic-related feats - albeit he/she is limited by what his/her religion allows. The character also gains the Basic Spells \textit{(Telekinessis, Lighting, Energy Bolt)}.
