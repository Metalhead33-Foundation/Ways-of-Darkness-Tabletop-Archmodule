\textbf{Dwarves} are a race indigenous to Artograch, with an average lifespan of 200 years, and average height of 120 centimetres or 3 feet and 11.2 inches. Due to the fact that they are rather short-statued humanoid mammals and speak a language related to Halfling, they are sometimes grouped in with the Halflings and Gnomes as the \SoCalled{Norlokian races}, even though they are incapable of interbreeding with each other, and thus may not even be biologically related, despite the superficial resemblance.\newline
The Dwarves are one of the most easily recognizable races of Artograch. Short but muscular statue, crude humour, mild xenophobia, fondness for beer and women, you will almost instantly recognize the dwarf. Having been a closed people for millennia, dwarves are not very trusting with foreigners \textit{(other than the gnomes whom they don’t really consider foreigners at all)}, but they are generous with the ones who earn their trust. They are also known for their talent at blacksmithing, mining and melee weapons. Dwarven steel is universally considered the best material for making both weapons and armour, and no one can deny the beauty of dwarven-made ornaments that decorate armour and weapons that would be already considered nicely-made even without them. Dwarves’ skin colour can vary from yellowish brown to pale white. A dwarf's hair colour can be blond, red, brown or black. In Dwarven society, if a male does not have a beard, he isn't considered male. Traditionally, the dwarves lived in clans that constantly bickered amongst each other, but historical events six centuries ago changed all of that.\newline
