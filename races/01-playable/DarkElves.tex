\textbf{Dark Elves} are a race without a unified country, living in underground clans in dungeon-cities below the the ground, though also being present in several surface states - namely the Kingdoms of Etrand and Froturn - in high numbers as diaspora. They have rather long lifespans, theoretically ten times that of a human \textit{(and they're also typically taller than humans, not to mention their sharp ears and blue-ish grey skin)}, ageing at one tenth a human's rate after reaching the age of eighteen. They descendants of Wood Elves and High Elves who were banished after experimenting with the dark arts, creating their own exodus, where the environment - and the new religion - has altered their appearence. The average adult Dark Elf is about 180 centimetres \textit{(5 feet and 11 inches)} tall, regardless of gender \textit{(albeit men to tend to be slightly taller on average)}.\newline
