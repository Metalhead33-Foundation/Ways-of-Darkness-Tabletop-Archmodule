\textbf{Halflings} are a race indigenous to Artograch, with an average lifespan of 150 years, and average height of 130 centimetres or 4 feet and 3.1 inches. Due to the fact that they are rather short-statued humanoid mammals and speak a language related to Dwarven, they are sometimes grouped in with the Dwarves and Gnomes as the \SoCalled{Norlokian races}, even though they are incapable of interbreeding with each other, and thus may not even be biologically related, despite the superficial resemblance.\newline
Halflings are a race of smart, inventive survivors and adventurers, known for their curiousity and boldness. They are easily seduced by riches, but they prefer spending money, for they are a race definitely not made famous by their frugality. Their skin is ruddy, their hair is typically either black, brown or red, and either straight or curly \textit{(never wavy)}, and their eyes are usually brown or black. Halfling men very often grow out their sideburns, but seldom do they also grow a beard or mustache. They prefer dressing for comfort and practicality, and in spite of their love of riches, they typically shun jewellery. They love to enjoy the little things in life, such as smoking their pipes.\newline
