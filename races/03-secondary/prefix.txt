\chapter{Secondary Races}
\textbf{Secondary races} are races that people aren't usually born into, but instead are turned into, usually via some sort of magic. Most secondary races are undead, and their condition is caused by a symbiotic relationship between their own animated corpse and a tiny creature that is responsible for the animation: the only cure to such a condition is a final death.
