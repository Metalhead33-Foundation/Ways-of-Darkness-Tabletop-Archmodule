\section{Disgraced Aristocrat}
Born into a noble family, good with weapons and destined to be noble protector of the realm, you were once the pride of your father - emphasis on was. You did something that upset your family so terribly, that they disowned you, depriving you of your inheritance and much of your wealth, effectively sending you off to walk the earth. Now you travel the lands as a disgruntled mercenary looking for lucrative jobs that might help you become as rich as you once used to be.
