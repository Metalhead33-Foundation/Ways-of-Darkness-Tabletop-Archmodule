\section{Street Urchin}
You came from one of the lowest castes of society one can image - the streets were your parents, the alley was your home, the chattering of thugs was your music. You were a street urchin, a homeless kid who had to survive by a mixture of begging, stealing, and odd jobs. Even survival alone was no easy undertaking, but you managed it somehow - and developed several valuable skills in the process. You know the shanty alleys like the palm of your own hand, but you are most certainly an uncultured person who never had much of an opportunity to learn how to act like a civilized person. A traumatic childhood of begging, stealing and hard living has hardened you, has also made you somewhat of a ruffian with criminal tendencies.

	\item You cannot choose Etiquette, Naturalism or Logic as your starting feats. You can still acquire them later on though.
	\item Due to your status as a formerly homeless person, upper-class people will have a lower opinion of you than they otherwise would. \textit{(enforcement up to the GM)}
	\item Low starting money.
\end{itemize}
