\section{Pirate}
Avast, ye scurvy dog! Never feeling quite at home among all those landlubbers, you made the seven seas your home, constantly on the hunt for poorly defended ships full of loot and plunder! You know the open waters like the palm of your own hand, and it is more than obvious that an encounter with you won't be plasant for any merchant ships. Yarrrr!
