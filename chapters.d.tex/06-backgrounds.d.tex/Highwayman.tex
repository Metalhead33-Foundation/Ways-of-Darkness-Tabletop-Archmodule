\section{Highwayman}
You are not ashamed to admit it, that you don't earn your daily bread by legal means: you're a bandit, someone who preys on unaccompanied travellers for money and food alike, and if all else fails, you occasionally go raiding. Whatever it takes to survive, as long as \SoCalled{whatever} doesn't include getting a real honest job, right? 

The hard life has trained your body, but has also scarred your face. Since you're still alive, it can be assumed that you know how to swing your weapons, and you are either a good sneak or a good runner - or both. 

\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You start with the Basic Sneaking, Light Armour Conditioning, Basic Bludgeoners and Basic Street Smarts feats for free.
	\item You can choose an Advanced Weapon feat for free - or two Basic ones instead. Alternatively, if you choose Advanced Bludgeoners, you can choose a Basic one for free.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You may only pick 10 feats at the beginning instead of the usual 16.
	\item You cannot choose Etiquette or Logic as your starting feats. You can still acquire them later on though.
	\item Very low starting money.
\end{itemize}
