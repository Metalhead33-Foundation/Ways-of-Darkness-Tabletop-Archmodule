\section{Spitzel}
You're a spitzel - an informant, a spy, a mole. Some would call you a traitor, but you were always an infiltrator in any groups you joined with the sole purpose of spying on the group and informing your actual boss. Of course, to do that succesfully and not get caught, you had to develop quite the skillset: diaesthese \Parentheses{the art of fooling people, and avoiding being fooled by other people}, stealth, lockpicking, even forgery and smuggling.

Now you were hired to make use of your skills and spy on a group of adventurers, constantly sending back reports to your master.

\textbf{Note:} To avoid metagaming, you should lie about your background to other players and only the DM should know about your true backgrounds, unless the character reveals it himself.

\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You start with the Basic Diaesthese, Basic Smuggling, Basic Sneaking, Basic Lockpicking and Basic Forgery.
	\item \Bonus{2} to Charisma.
	\item Medium starting money.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You may only pick 10 feats at the beginning instead of the usual 16.
\end{itemize}
