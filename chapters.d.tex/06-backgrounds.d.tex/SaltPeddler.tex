\section{Saltbird}
You always identified yourself as a humble salt peddler - though, during the earlier stages of your career, not even naive peasant girls could be fooled by your diguise, and it was obvious that you were a crimper, a \SoCalled{saltbird}, someone who illegally sells \SoCalled{salt}: a euphemism for a highly addictive drug that merely happens to resemble salt by virtue of being white and coarse.

After nearly getting caught a thousand times and reinventing your identity perhaps a thousand times, you have more or less mastered the art of smuggling and trafficking... - or so you think, obviously still having much to learn. In addition to honing your \SoCalled{salt peddling} skills, you also learned the basics of defending yourself in case business goes awry, and having to track down hidden merchandise also had the side effect of teaching you the basics of tracking.

\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You start with the Advanced Street Smarts feat, Basic Diaesthese, Advanced Smuggling, Basic Forgery, Basic Bludgeoners, Basic Crossbows, Basic Riding, Basic Tracking.
	\item Mediocre starting money.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You may only pick 8 feats at the beginning instead of the usual 16.
	\item You cannot choose Etiquette or Naturalism as your starting feats. You can still acquire them later on though.
	\item You are a wanted criminal in your home territory. \textit{(enforcement up to the GM)}
\end{itemize}
