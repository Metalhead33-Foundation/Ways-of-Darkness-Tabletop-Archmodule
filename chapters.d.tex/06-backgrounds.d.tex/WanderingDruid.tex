\section{Wandering Druid}
Not all druids spend their time in their forests praying to the spirits of nature and holding masses at shrines - some druids wander the lands and walk the earth, for various reasons: to spread their faith and proselytize, to seek out ancient artifacts that could be important to their people, or to fight against the forces that seek to corrupt nature and endanger life.

The character cannot be an Atheist, and must follow a religion with Shamanism amongst its virtues. A Wandering Druid takes on the advantages and restrictions of a Druid of his/her religion's virtues.

\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The following feats for free: Basic Polearms, Basic Bludgeoners, Basic Naturalism, Advanced Literacy \Parentheses{at your native language}, Magica Naturae, Basic Aeromancy, Basic Geomancy.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can only pick 8 feats at the start, instead of the usual 16.
	\item Druids are forbidden from starting with - and later taking on - the feats Armour Conditioning, Swords, Bows, Crossbows and Firearms, as long as they remain on their path.
	\item The character can never learn Necromancy - as the Naturalist religion abhors the practice, considers Undead unnatural and agrees that desecrating the dead is a serious sin that should not be tolerated.
	\item Low amount of starting money.
\end{itemize}
