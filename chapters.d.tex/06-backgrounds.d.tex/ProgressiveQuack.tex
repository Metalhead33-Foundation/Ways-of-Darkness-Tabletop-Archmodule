\section{Progressive Quack}
You are an eccentric figure - you save lives, but not via using the conventional methods, and definitely not via subscribing to conventional medical wisdom of your time. You don't believe in the four humours, you deny the significance of the three doshas or the six elements, or anything like that - you believe a completely different theory when it comes to medicine, one that hasn't gained mainstream acceptance yet, in spite of being far closer to reality than what everyone else believes.

Sadly, just about every academian laughs at your theories and sees you as a charlatan quack, despite the fact that you have saved countless lives before by putting your \SoCalled{ridiculous} theories to the test. So, instead of trying to please those stubborn academs and regulators of medicine, you have decided to be a wandering medicine man, curing the sick as you go from town to town and village from village, steering clear of those egg-headed intellectuals who think they know better than you, putting their blind faith in nonsensical mainstream theories like the \SoCalled{four humours}.
