\section{Wandering Monk}
Not all monks spend their time in their monasteries hugging books and praying all day long - some monks wander the lands and walk the earth, for various reasons: to spread their faith and proselytize, to collect ancient artifacts in their church's name \Parentheses{so that their head of religion can hoard them}, or to just act out their religion's commandements in the wild: which, for Light-aligned monks, would mean being a good samaritan, healing the sick, helping those in need and hunting down the demons and the undead - and for Dark-aligned monks, it would be spreading pain and suffering, one can presume. 

The character cannot be an Atheist, must follow a religion. A Wandering Monk takes on the advantages and restrictions of a Monk of his/her religion's virtues.

\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The following feats for free: Advanced Martial Arts, Basic Logic, Advanced Literacy \Parentheses{at your native language}, Basic Etiquette, Magica Divinitatis.
	\item Other bonuses depend on the monk's religion's virtues.
	\item Light-aligned Monks - Monks of Titanius - start with Advanced knowledge of the Classical High Elven language \Parentheses{Classical Language feat}. Other monks instead start with Expert Literacy at their native language's script, instead of Advanced.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can only pick 6 feats at the start, instead of the usual 16.
	\item The character can never learn Necromancy - not even Dark-aligned Monks, as every religion in existence \Parentheses{even Dark-aligned ones} abhors the practice and agree that desecrating the dead is a serious sin that should not be tolerated.
	\item Low amount of starting money.
\end{itemize}
