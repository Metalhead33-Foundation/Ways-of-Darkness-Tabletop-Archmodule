\section{Mages' Guild Dropout}
Where do people learn the basics of Arcane Magic? For the majority of people, there are only two possible answers to that question: either from their parents, or from the Mages Guild. For you, the answer is the latter. You were enrolled into the Mages Guild as a teenager or a young adult, learned the basics, but the lessons proved to be too boring for you - after all, you're a \Parentheses{wo}man of action, not a bookworm! Eventually, you dropped out - either by voluntarily quitting, or by being kicked out for your deliquent behaviour. In the latter case, it never bothered you: you always knew that your call was in the outside, as an adventurer.
