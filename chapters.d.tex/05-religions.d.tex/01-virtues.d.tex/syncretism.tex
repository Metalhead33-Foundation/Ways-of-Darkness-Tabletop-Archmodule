\ReligionRow{Syncretism}{A \textbf{syncretistic} religion is a religion open to \textbf{syncretism}, which is the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought, the blending of multiple religious systems into one. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. As such, such religions tend to be very tolerant and open to dialogue with different faiths, tolerating their presence and eager to learn from them and their ways.}{Users of Clerical Magic may take up other magic feats - any of them - by studying with priests of other religions.}{Divine Favour is granted for promoting dialogue and reconciliation between hostile faiths, studying from other religions or convincing other religious leaders to adot elements of your own faith}{Dogmatism}
