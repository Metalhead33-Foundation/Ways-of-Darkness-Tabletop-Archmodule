\ReligionRow{Pacifism}{\textbf{Pacifistic} religions emphasize the importance of peace and abhor violence. Pacifism is not to be confused with altruism - while the two may often go hand-in-hand together, a pacifist might simply abhor violence without rushing to the aid of someone in distress, while an altruist might not shy away from violence in the name of protecting the weak and the needy.}{Clerical Magic users \textbf{cannot} learn Olethromancy.

Because this virtue does not grant any magic skills, it has to be combined with one that does so.}{Divine Favour is granted for preserving the peace and actively opposing and preventing violence.}{Incompatible with Kraterocracy}
