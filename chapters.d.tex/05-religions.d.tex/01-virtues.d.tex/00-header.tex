\section{Virtues}
As stated in the Basic Ruleset, each religion has a set of virtues that its believers hold dear. A religion typically has multiple virtues, but different virtues may contradict each other - a religion may not hold two contradicting virtues at the same time. Some religious virtues may be made redundant when combined, but for the sake of realism and faithfulnes to the lore, religions may hold redundant virtues, even if it is \SoCalled{wasteful} gameplay-wise.
