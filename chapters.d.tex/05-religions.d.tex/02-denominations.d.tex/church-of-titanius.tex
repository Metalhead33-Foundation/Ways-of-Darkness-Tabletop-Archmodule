The \textbf{Church of Titanius} is a monotheistic religion originating in the Kingdom of Froturn, whose followers make up the majority in Froturn, Etrand, Etrancoast and Artaburro. Followed by over seven million people, it is the largest religion on the continent of Artograch. Titanists worship a god named Titanius, the God of Light, believing him to be the only deity who actually exists \Parentheses{considering every other one to be an impostor}, all-powerful, omnipotent, guiding his faithful via prophets, heroes, revealed scriptres and historical events. The religion's main holy scripture is the Book of Visions, but several other, later books have became part of the canon as well.

The Titanist religion is organized through the Church of Titanius, which is headed by the Hierophant, its relations with secular authorities guided by the Yanus Protocol. Not all self-proclaimed Titanius-worshippers are part of the Church of Titanius - several self-proclaimed believers disagree with official church doctrines, which leads to them being branded as heretics and persecuted by the Inquisition accordingly, with the most famous heretical community being the Order of the Eternal Crystal Flower.
