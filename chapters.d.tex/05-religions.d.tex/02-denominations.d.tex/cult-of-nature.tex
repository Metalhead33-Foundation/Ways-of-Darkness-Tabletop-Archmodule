The \textbf{Cult of Nature} is the religion of the Wood Elves, although not every single Wood Elf is its follower, and people of any race can follow this religion, however druids must follow this religion. Altrough the faith itself doesn't have any unity or clergy, it unites a state through religion: Kingdom of Dragoc \Parentheses{country of wood elves}. Although the laws and government of the kingdom is theocratic, the country has freedom of religion, because the Wood Elves’ religion promotes freedom of faith.

The creation myth of this religion is rather short, and it spreads through oral tradition rather than written documents. According to the legend, the proto-elves were the children of Selenna and Goronnion the proto-elves lived together with their gods \Parentheses{Goronnion and Selenna} on the Island of Eternal Life, but one day, they started to grow arrogant and forget about their gods, starting to exploit and destroy the treasure which is given to them and the Island of Eternal Life. Selenna and Goronnion couldn’t bear it anymore, so they expelled the Proto-Elves, and then destroyed the Island of Eternal Life. However, some of the descedants of the proto-elves, incidentally the wood elven druids returned to the loving arms of Selenna and Goronnion, and helped the wood elves to see the correct way.

The followers of this religion believe in two gods.

 \toprule
\SinElement{10}{\textbf{Engaging in unfair hunt} \Parentheses{e.g. deliberately hunting wounded animals, using poison, etc.}, \textbf{to hunt when it is not hunting season} }{Goronnion's creatures deserve a fair fight and a dignified death. There is no honour in an unfair hunt. The wild game is like a berry bush, it must be given time to re-grow after each harvest, lest they be extinguished.}
\SinElement{9}{\textbf{Taking the name of Selenna and Goronnion in vain, eating \SoCalled{heavy food} outside of a feast}}{The names of the two deities are sacred, and thus are not to be uttered lightly. Additionally, feasting is a ritual to Selenna and Goronnion, eating meat is a display of homage to Goronnion - eating \SoCalled{heavy food} casually is to take the name of the divines in vain. When feeling hungry outside of a feast, eat \SoCalled{light food}.}
\SinElement{8}{\textbf{Cowardice} \Parentheses{e.g. to turn down a duel}, \textbf{to condone tyranny and not liberate the oppressed when having an opportunity to do so}}{To deny the beast within that Goronnion implanted in your heart is a sin - but so is to not help others discover this best. The creations of Selenna and Goronnion were born free, and thus, it is sinful to oppress them, and also sinful to condone this oppression.}
\SinElement{7}{\textbf{Oathbreaking, adultery}}{To break an oath is to bring dishonour upon yourself, and a liar is caught faster than a limping dog. To mingle with someone else's beloved is to break your oath to your beloved, and to violate the the one who loves the other.}
\SinElement{6}{\textbf{Theft from the Needy}}{To steal from someone who needs it more than you, is shameful and sinful.}
\SinElement{5}{\textbf{Intentional pollution}}{Selenna gave you a beautiful and bountiful nature full of game and sweet fruit - in return, she only asks that you respect it and abstain from destroying it.}
\SinElement{4}{\textbf{Holding slaves}}{Selenna and Goronnion made everyone free. To put someone in chains is an insult against the creator who made them free.}
\SinElement{3}{\textbf{Murder, rape, torture, mutilation}}{To extinguish someone's tree of life without a proper cause - such as self-defense, defense of nature, liberating from tyranny, etc. - is to insult the creators}
\SinElement{2}{\textbf{To burn a forest}}{The forest is home to spirits of the nature, to incarnations of Selenna and Goronnion, to wild game, to plants, and to the Wood Elves. To cause a forest fire is to spit on the image of Selenna and Goronnion.}
\SinElement{1}{\textbf{To create a desert}}{A burned-down forest may recover over time, but when a lust green landscape is turned into a desolate wasteland, it can be known for sure, that the spirit of Selenna has been ejected from the land. To eject Selenna's spirit from the land is the gravest of all sins.}
