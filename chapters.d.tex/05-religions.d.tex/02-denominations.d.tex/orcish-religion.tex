The \textbf{Orcish Religion} is a duotheistic religion, and the dominant religion of Brutang. The name is misleading, as it is not merely the ethnic religion of the Orcs, but is also practiced by Brutang's Goblin and Ogre populations as well. Orcish and Goblin diaspora is divided in practice of the religion: freed ones tend to convert to local religions, while slaves attempt to practice the Orcish religion.

Adherents of the Orcish Religion believe that the world is divided in two: the physical reality that they live in is called Hra'zarít, the realm of Hra'zah, the Earth Mother, who creates life from dirt and water; where living things live, die and are reborn in an eternal circle, but the most valiant of warriors break free from this circle and enter Guzbogrít, the realm of Guzbog, the Sky Father, where they spend their afterlife fighting in an arena, drinking the finest of drinks, eating the finest of food and being fondled and pampered by the most beautiful of women.

In an effort to break out of Hra'zarít and ascend to earn the right to enter Guzbogrít, warriors are excepted to prove that they are worthy by waging war in bounds with the Orcish Warrior Code \Parentheses{waging war against the descendants of Thorm'fa's enemies, never betraying allies, not showing weakness}. Their belief is that the weak must fear the strong, but they also believe that the strong has a responsibility to follow the warrior code, and never be dishonourable: while displays of weakness are considered a sin, breaking one's oath is considered an even worse sin.

Under the belief that the strong has the right to treat the weak the way they like, the religion permits and condones slavery and rape, and is the only religion in Artograch to condone incest. Nevertheless, oathbreaking and betrayal are considered among the worst sins in this religion - oaths and debts are taken very seriously. Saving someone's life is supposed to be repaid by a \SoCalled{life debt}, an oath to sacrifice one's life for the savior if there is an opportunity for that.

Another principle of the religion is that Hra'zah the Earth Mother and Guzbog the Sky Father are actively helping the Orcs, so long as they keep appeasing them, mostly with various rituals and sacrifices. Shamans communicate the will of these two divines, and also lead the ritual drumming, ritual fires and present the sacrifices - in case the sacrifice is a living being, it is the Shaman's duty to perform the kill.

\SinElement{10}{\textbf{Respecting the laws of the foreigners}}{The outsiders and their silly civilization were created for you to plunder and rape, not to respect and admire. You are supposed to be raiding and raping them to avange what they have done to Thorm'Fa, not trading and peacefully coexisting with them.}

\SinElement{6}{\textbf{Neglecting to honour Guzbog and Hra'zat by a sacrifice}}{Guzbog and Hra'zat expect regular tribute - in the form of ritual dances, ritual fires, sacrifices - in exchange for helping you through your earthly journey.}
\SinElement{5}{\textbf{Stealing instead of fighting}}{A true warrior fights for what he/she feels entitled to, and does not snatch it dishonorably. If you covet someone's land, gold or wife, you must fight for your right to take it.}
\SinElement{4}{\textbf{Homosexuality}}{Hra'zah separated the sexes for a reason. A man must plant his seeds inside a woman's garden, and a woman must share her garden with a man, not a woman.}
\SinElement{3}{\textbf{Intentional Oathbreaking}}{A true warrior always lives up to his words to the best of his abilities.}
\SinElement{2}{\textbf{Treason}}{A true warrior does not betray his/her allies.}
\SinElement{1}{\textbf{Betrayal of your kind}}{A traitor to one's own race is a traitor to Hra'zah and Guzbog, and shall never enter Guzbog's realm.}
