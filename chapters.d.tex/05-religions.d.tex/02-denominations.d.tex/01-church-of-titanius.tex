The \textbf{Church of Titanius} is a monotheistic religion originating in the Kingdom of Froturn, whose followers make up the majority in Froturn, Etrand, Etrancoast and Artaburro. Followed by over seven million people, it is the largest religion on the continent of Artograch. Titanists worship a god named Titanius, the God of Light, believing him to be the only deity who actually exists \Parentheses{considering every other one to be an impostor}, all-powerful, omnipotent, guiding his faithful via prophets, heroes, revealed scriptres and historical events. The religion's main holy scripture is the Book of Visions, but several other, later books have became part of the canon as well.

The Titanist religion is organized through the Church of Titanius, which is headed by the Hierophant, its relations with secular authorities guided by the Yanus Protocol. Not all self-proclaimed Titanius-worshippers are part of the Church of Titanius - several self-proclaimed believers disagree with official church doctrines, which leads to them being branded as heretics and persecuted by the Inquisition accordingly, with the most famous heretical community being the Order of the Eternal Crystal Flower. 

\textbf{Virtues:} Altruism, Dogmatism, Heliolatry, Patriarchy, Proselytism

\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{Hierarchy of Sins}} \\
\midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{10}              & Sinful or selfish thoughts \Parentheses{e.g. lusting after someone, but not acting upon it}             \\
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Sinful thoughts don't always lead to sinful acts, but the thinker must reflect upon themselves and clear their mind before it is too late.             \\
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{9}              & Minor selfish acts             \\
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Self-centeredness is the path to darkness \\
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{8}              & Adultery             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Mingling in flesh with someone else's spouse is a violation of the trust your own spouse has for you, and an act of offense against the person whose spouse you are sleeping with. \\
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{7}              & Theft             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Titanius does not permit stealing the fruits of someone else's hard labour. \\
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{6}              & Lawlessness, promotion of anarchy, physical assault or intentional property damage             \\
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Render onto the king what rightfully belongs to him, unless he seeks to undermine the faith. Titanius is a god of law and order, and has no need for petty anarchists. \\ 
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{5}              & Murder, planned or not             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Destroying what Titanius has created without a proper cause - such as self-defense - is an insult to Titanius. \\ 
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{4}              & Sodomy, homosexuality             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} Titanius separated the sexes for a reason. Sodomites - especially female sodomites - undermine the fabric of Titanist society. \\ 
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{3}              & Torture, mutilation, rape             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} To cause such pain that even death would be a relief, is a sin even greater than murder itself. \\\ 
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{2}              & Undermining the faith, helping enemies of the faith             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} How can you call yourself a Titanist, if you actively collaborate with those who seek to undermine your religion? \\ 
                                 \midrule
\multirow{2}{*}{1}              & Outright apostasy             \\ 
                                 & - \hspace{\parindent} \textit{Rationale:} To reject Titanius is to reject life. \\
