Human Paganism was the main religion of the Humans before the establishment of the Kingdom of Etrand and the Etrandish annexation of the Kingdom of Hulra. Unlike the monotheistic Titanist religion and the dualistic Naturalist religion, Human Paganism was completely polytheistic, with a relatively large roster of deities to worship.

In Etrand, the religion went underground after the unification by Corlagon, and gradually became virtually extinct over two centuries in all of Etrand but maybe a few obscure rural areas. After the Etrandish conquest of Hulra in the late 3rd century, paganism remained a rather strong and persistent part of the Etrancoasti/Hulran way of life for three more centuries, despite the harsh persecution by both the Etrandish and later native Etrancoasti authorities, finally losing ground to the Titanist faith only during the 7th century - it is estimated between 10\% and 20\% of Etrancoast's population are still crypto-Pagans clinging to the old ways. \Parentheses{See \href{https://ways-of-darkness.sonck.nl/Demographics_of_Etrancoast\#Religion}{Religion in Etrancoast}.}
