Called \textbf{Hróthward} in Etrandish, \textbf{Rýthwardar} in Etrancoasti, he's the pagan God of Thunder, War and Honour. He was usually depicted as a tall, muscular, bald, clean-shaven man with scars on his face, lemon-yellow eyes, small aquiline nose, strong jaw, wearing a breastplate and swinging a sword of thunder. He is also desribed as an even-minded god who can always keep his cool, never lets his emotions get in the way of his judgement.

It is said that when the bravest warriors die, they have must have beer with Hróthward/Rýthwardar, and regularly do arm-wrestling with the god, lest they be considered unmanly and unfit for their place in the paradise. During wartime, unimportant prisoners are war - and sometimes chieftains too, for symbolic effect - are sacrificed for Hróthward/Rýthwardar, so that the tribe gets blessed by the god and makes sure that their war efforts are successful.
