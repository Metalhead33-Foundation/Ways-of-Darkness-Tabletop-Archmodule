\textbf{Orcs} are an oddball among the group of Elven races - just like Humans, they look nothing like Elves, despite being genetically descended from the Ancestral Elves, albeit indirectly: the Orcs are descendants of a group of Wood Elves who were exiled for their war crimes and subsequent rebellion against their own country's authority, first tortured then banished into the frozen wastelands of Brutang with the hopes of them dying from exposure or being killed by the native Goblins and Ogres. Instead, these exiled renegades came to dominate the natives, but for some unknown reason, their children and descendants all became green-skinned beings. Even the Orcs themselves aren't sure today how did their ancestors transition from being Wood Elves to being Orcs - perhaps a curse?


Orcs have a lifespan roughly three times that of humans, which means that they age at one third of a human's rate after reaching the age of eighteen. Orcs have an average height of 210 centimetres, or roughly 6 feet and 11 inches. Orcs are well-known for one of the most muscular races, albeit their green skin, shorter lifespan and ugly faces give people the impression that they have more in common with the Goblins and Ogres than the Wood Elves they supposedly descended from. Their true origins still remain a mystery, as it remains impossible to tell legend from reality.
