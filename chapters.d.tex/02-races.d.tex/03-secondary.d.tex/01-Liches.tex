\textbf{Liches} are sentient undead creatures who resemble skeletons, but are in fact a power to be reckoned with, as the ritual of transformation in which liches are made is lethal to anyone who doesn't possess sufficient amount of magical power to have all of their body \Parentheses{save for their bones} burn away, yet live. In exchange for the efforts taken prior to the ritual and the excruciating pain sustained during the ritual, they gain eternal life, increased magical powers and being freed from various other mortal restraints, such as mortal needs and mortal desires.
