\section{Vampires}
\MoreInfo{Vampirism}


\textbf{Vampires} are sentient undead creatures who - unlike Liches - largely retain their original mortal looks, albeit with a few characteristics \Parentheses{paler skin, unnatural eye colours, more prominent, pointy and sharp canine teeth}. Unlike lichdoom - which is a condition caused by a ritual - vampirism is caused by a parasitical organism infecting a living sentient mammal, killing it and reanimating its body, sharing control over the body with the original brains and soul, establishing a symbiotic relationship, just like with theriantropes. The parasite demands blood, and will drive the vampire to utter madness \Parentheses{and eventually bodily decay} if it is not delivered, but in exchange, it grants the vampire eternal life, liberation from mortal needs for food and water, as well as superior physical power. In spite of being undead creatures who are supposed to be clinically dead, those who are turned vampires prematurely will still physically mature into adults capable of sexual reproduction: the parsite inside them makes sure, that as long as they are fed with enough blood at regular intervals, some of their mortal functions will continue to work, such as the ones responsible for growing into an adult, for appreciating the taste of mortal food and beverages, and for sexual reproduction - but woe be to a vampire who neglects feeding, as they will begin to experience both bodily decay and mental degeneration.


So-called \SoCalled{pure-blooded vampires} \Parentheses{the offsprings of two vampires} and \SoCalled{half-vampires} \Parentheses{the offsprings of a mortal and vampire} are immune to the harsh rays of the sun from birth, while to regular vampires, the scorching touch of the sun is lethal for roughly three centuries, during which they gradually build up an immunity and gain resistance to it.


The parasite that causes vampirism is one very prone to mutation, which explains the high diversity of vampire clans with different powers unique to them.
