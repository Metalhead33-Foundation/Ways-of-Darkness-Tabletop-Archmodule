\section{Headhunter}
You're a headhunter - you hunt heads for money. Unlike an assassin, whose job is to sneak in and eliminate your target preferably without witnesses, and sneak out, your job as a headhunter is to bring your targets back to your clients, either as corpses or as prisoners. Whether they want the objective alive or dead differs from client to client - many are happy with you merely bringing back a decapitated head as proof that the deed has been done: hence the title \textit{"headhunter"}.
