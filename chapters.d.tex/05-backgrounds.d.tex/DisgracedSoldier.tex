\section{Disgraced Soldier}
Not all adventurers were born with a sense of self-righteousness and a desire to go out into the wild with the ultimate goal of turning the world upside down. Some people are are perfectly fine with a simple life, until fate forces them into the boots of an adventurer.

You used to be in an army, you used to be someone who followed orders, slept in barracks and took part in drills. But then something went terribly went wrong, and now you're no longer part of the army. Perhaps you offended the wrong person, and they kicked you out? Or maybe they tried to execute you for treason or insubordination, but you succesfully escaped? Either way, the army doesn't want you back, and now you're an adventurer - or a mercenary?
