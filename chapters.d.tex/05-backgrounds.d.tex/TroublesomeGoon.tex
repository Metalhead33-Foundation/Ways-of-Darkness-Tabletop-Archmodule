\section{Troublesome Goon}
In some ways, you're like the dumber brother of the Adventuring Mobster - you're strong, but also dumb and clumsy. They called you the \SoCalled{beating boy} \Parentheses{or beating girl}, because you were the were the boy beating the ones who needed to be beaten, at least according to the boss. You were a thug, a goon, a dumb muscle - and still are, just not in the service of a mafia boss. Keeping you around was more trouble than its worth, but your boss apparently did not have the heart to straight-up have you killed - so you were \SoCalled{reassigned} to a different place, where you can be troublesome without bringing shame to the mob.

You have more or less forgotten why you are where you are to begin with - or maybe you are not as stupid as everyone thinks, and have realized that you got betrayed, and want to go independent. Either way, your once undying loyalty to your boss is in the past, and now you just want an opportunity to earn money with fighting.
