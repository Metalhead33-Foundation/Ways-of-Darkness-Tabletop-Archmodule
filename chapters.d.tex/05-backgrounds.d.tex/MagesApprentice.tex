\section{Mage's Apprentice}
There are many ways to get acquinted with magic from an early age: both of your parents were magicians, one of your parents was a magician, or you were orphaned and taken in by a magician. Either way, you were raised to be a magician, with your caretaker teaching you the basics at a relatively early age. Your open-minded child brains were ready to suck all that knowledge in, putting you decades ahead of any adult trying to learn magic. On the negative side, your strict caretaker didn't leave much time for you to play, or develop any other skills.
