\section{Silver Spoon}
You were born into and raised as a member of a family belonging to the upper echelons of society. This means you have connections, you know people of importance, and you are known by people of importance. All well and good, but your pampered and sheltered childhood has spoiled you, reducing your ability to learn.


\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \Bonus{2} to Charisma
	\item The following feats for free: Advanced Literacy \Parentheses{at your native langauge's script}, Advanced Etiquette, Basic Riding, Basic Arithmetic, Basic Classical Language feat \Parentheses{at a classical language of choosing}
	\item Higher-class people will have a higher opinion of you than they otherwise would. \textit{(enforcement up to the GM)}
	\item High amount of starting money.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can only choose 8 feats at the beginning, instead of the usual 16.
	\item \Malus{1} to Willpower
	\item Lower-class people will have a lower opinion of you than they otherwise would. \textit{(enforcement up to the GM)}
	\item Slower learning and experience \textit{(enforcement up to the GM - in a video game, this should be a malus to experience gain)}
\end{itemize}
