\section{Vengeful Guard}
Many city guards claim, that they used to be adventurers until they took an arrow to the knee - for you, it was the other way around. You used to be an ordinary city guard, until you took a personal tragedy to the heart. Some evil villain has killed your father, your mother, your brother, your sister, your wife, your son, your best friend or your uncle's dentist's neighbour - or maybe all of them! 

Whatever the case, you left the post and took on the mantle of adventurer to avange your loved one\Parentheses{s} and bring justice for your family. Having been a city guard means you have skills with certain weapons and know how the laws operate, but sadly, the wilderness and the rural areas are alien to you.
