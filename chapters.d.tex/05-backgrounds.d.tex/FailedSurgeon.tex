\section{Failed Surgeon}
The path to hell is paved with good intentions: you always came too late to save their lives, so you began to learn how to bring them back through magic. Sadly, neither the church, nor the local organization of 'respectable magicians' approve of such practiced, so you quickly became a pariah in society. Forced to leave everything behind, you became a wandering necromancer, looking for adventure - albeit not for the reasons your past self would have done it. Your persecution at the hands of the \textit{"champions of the light"} made you question all their dogmas about selflessness, and you accidentally fell off the other side of the horse: now your main motivation is your own growth. \newline
