\section{Savant Wizard}
You're a fucking retard - no realy, you are. But you're a special kind of retard: you're an idiot savant, someone who is socially retarded, but secretly very intelligent, and excells in one certain subject. For you, that one certain subject is magic. Since magical power is tied to intelligence, your aptitude for it is proof enough that you're not stupid - you're just socially retarded. Your brains simply ignore social conventions, you can never learn about proper behaviour, you behave and talk in a way that your own brains deem logical, and everyone thinks you are behaving like a mentally handicapped person. On the bright side, your brains are practically a calculator.
