Nereids look like mammals above the hip, but hash fish bodies under the hips. This means that they have two hands - allowing them to use two one-handed weapons or a single two-handed weapon at a time, or a single one-handed weapon and a shield. They have their torso and their head, but lack legs - instead, they have a large tail, whose loss is just as lethal as the loss of their torso or head. They have the same vitals as other mortal creatures, but they cannot be infected with vampirism or theriantropy.\newpage
