\textbf{Wood Elves} are the dominant race of the \textbf{Kingdom of Dragoc}. They have rather long lifespans, theoretically ten times that of a human \textit{(and they're also typically taller than humans, not to mention their sharp ears)}, ageing at one tenth a human's rate after reaching the age of eighteen. They descendants of those Ancestral Elves who crossed over from the Orient to colonize the Occident, making them a sister-race to the High Elves and Humans, who also directly evolved out of those Ancestral Elves. As an added bonus, Wood Elven women and men are well-known for being rivals to their High Elven counterparts in regards to beauty. The average adult Wood Elf is about 190 centimetres \textit{(6 feet and 3 inches)} tall, regardless of gender \textit{(albeit men to tend to be slightly taller on average)}.
