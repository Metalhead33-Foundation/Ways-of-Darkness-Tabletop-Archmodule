\textbf{Half-Elves} are hybrids of Humans and any of the aforementioned Elven races \textit{(High Elves, Wood Elves, Dark Elves)}. To be specific, this race only includes only so-called \SoCalled{clean hybrids} - as in, people with 45-55\% Human blood and 45-55\% Elven blood. People where one side dominates - whether it's the Human side or Elven side - are classified as \SoCalled{unclean hybrids}, and thus get shoehorned into the Human or Elven race. Their lifespan is halfway between that of a Human and Elf, thus around five times that of a human's, ageing at one fifth the rate after reaching the age of eighteen.
