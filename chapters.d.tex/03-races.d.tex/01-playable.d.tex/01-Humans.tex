\textbf{Humans} are the dominant race of the \textbf{Kingdom of Etrand} and its vassal, the \textbf{Earldom of Etrancoast}, albeit they are also present in high numbers in the \textbf{Principality of Gabyr}, constituting slightly more than half of its population, albeit they're not politically dominant there. In spite of their short lifespan - less than one century! - and their clear lack of pointy ears, humans are in fact an Elven race, descendants of those Ancestral Elves who crossed over from the Orient to colonize the Occident, making them a sister-race to the Wood Elves and High Elves, who also directly evolved out of those Ancestral Elves.

The average human male is 175 centimetres \textit{(5 feet and 9 inches)} tall, while the average human female is 165 centimetres \textit{(5 feet and 5 inches)} tall, however, humans possess much greater variation amongst themselves in regards to height than other races, adult humans being as tall as 215 centimetres \textit{(84 inches or 7 feet)} or as short as 130 centimetres \textit{(4 feet and 3 inches)} not being unheard of either. With possibly the exception of the Lizardmen with the varied colours of their scale, humans are the most diverse race on Artograch, with a large variety of hair colours \textit{(black, brown, blond, red, auburn)} and eye colours \textit{(brown, blue, hazel, grey, green)} occouring naturally.
