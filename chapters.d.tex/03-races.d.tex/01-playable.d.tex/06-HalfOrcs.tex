\textbf{Half-Orcs} are hybrids of Orcs and any of the other Elven races \textit{(Humans, High Elves, Wood Elves, Dark Elves)} - from a gameplay perspective, we don't distinguish between Orc-Human and Orc-Elf hybrids, as Orkish traits tend to be the most salient for both. To be specific, this race only includes only so-called \SoCalled{clean hybrids}- as in, people with 45-55\% Orkish blood and 45-55\% Human/Elven blood. People where one side dominates - whether it's the Orkish side or Human/Elven side - are classified as \SoCalled{unclean hybrids}, and thus get shoehorned into the Orkish or Human/Elven race. Their lifespan is halfway between the parent races, which would mean around 200 years for Human-Orc hybrids, 400 years for Orc-Elf hybrids.
