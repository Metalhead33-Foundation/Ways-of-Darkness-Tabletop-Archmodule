\textbf{Gnomes} are a race indigenous to Artograch, with an average lifespan of 300 years, and average height of 100 centimetres or 3 feet and 3.37 inches. Due to the fact that they are rather short-statued humanoid mammals and speak the Dwarven language, they are sometimes grouped in with the Dwarves and Halflings as the \SoCalled{Norlokian races}, even though they are incapable of interbreeding with each other, and thus may not even be biologically related, despite the superficial resemblance.


The Gnomes are a race like no other. While the Dwarves, Humans, Elves and even the self-proclaimed \SoCalled{spiritual} Lizardmen love gossiping about just about everything, from politics to the petty personal matters of anyone who isnâ€™t present, the gnomes are a whole different world. They discuss science and magic, not tratsch. Gnomish genius knows no limits. They construct complex machines, golems, clockwork engines, and even more. In addition to mastering mechanics, gnomes also excel at alchemy. While the Elves - especially the Wood Elves - are unrivalled masters of Herbalism and potion-making, the Gnomes prefer to explore the more obscure yet powerful side of Alchemy: transmutation. The art of turning worthless rock into diamonds and mere paper into gold is a dangerous art mastered only by the bravest of souls.


The gnomes have been living side-by-side with the dwarves for 5000 years, and against all odds, they kept their own culture, as a separate race - which is understandable, given how they are biologically incapable of interbreeding with Dwarves. Although gnomes are widely employed as alchemists, inventors and artillery engineers, they prefer to live amongst their own kind. They are fond of animals, gemstones, jokes and pranks. They like learning things in a personal way, and they always try to build up things by a new way.
