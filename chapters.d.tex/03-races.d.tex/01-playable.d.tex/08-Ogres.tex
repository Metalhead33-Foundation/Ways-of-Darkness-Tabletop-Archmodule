\textbf{Ogres} are a race indigenous to Artograch. Green-skinned, very muscular, very tall \textit{(average height of 250 centimetres, or 8 feet and 2.4 inches)} and very solitary, Ogres have an average lifespan of roughly twice of a human's. Before the arrival of the Orcs, Ogres had a symbiotic relationship with the Goblins: the thriftly Goblins visited foreign places to bring back foreign goods to enrich the land and the ogres, while the Ogres protected the land with their strong hands and xenophobia, giving the Goblins a good base of operations. This all changed with the arrival of the Orcs, who enslaved the Ogres using them for forced labour until they began fighting for emancipation, winning that fight in the more liberal-minded clans. Despite no longer being collectively enslaved by most Orkish clans anymore, Ogres are still somewhat of outsiders in Orkish societies, preferring to stay out of clan politics and abstain from aspiring for high positions in them.
