\textbf{Goblins} are a race indigenous to Artograch. Green-skinned, small \textit{(average of 110 cm, or 3 feet and 7.3 inches)}, agile and undemanding  they can live and thrive in just about any place: from the hot and scorching desert to the arctic wasteland. Thanks to their small size, they do not need big houses. Their small and agile fingers are good to hunting smaller animals and using bows. Their in-born night vision allows them to see in the darkness. They are much quicker and less noisy than the Orcs, which why is why the Orcish tribes of Brutang love employing them as scouts.


As an undemanding race that can thrive just about anywhere, they can be found in nearly all corners of Artograch, although their main domicile is in Brutang, which they share with the Orcs and Ogres. Before the arrival of the Orcs in Brutang, they had a symbiotic relationship with the Ogres: the thriftly Goblins visited foreign places to bring back foreign goods to enrich the land and the ogres, while the Ogres protected the land with their strong hands and xenophobia, giving the Goblins a good base of operations. This all changed with the arrival of the Orcs, with the Goblins of Brutang having to serve new - Orcish - masters. They earned their emancipation far quicker than the Ogres, as they provid their worth as merchants, scouts, diplomats and artisans fairly early on. Outside of Brutang, their tribes are mostly nomadic, making a living of stealing and trading. These goblin tribes often create caravans, wandering with their products, caught monsters and slaves, intending to sell them to someone. These caravans are often followed by scouts on wolfback to provide cover and to look for villages to pillage.


The Goblin race contains three subraces: Night Goblins, Wood Goblins and Hobgoblins, with \textbf{Night Goblins} being the sneaky ones who prefer to dwell in caves and lack claustrophobia and taphophobia of any kind; \textbf{Wood Goblins} who feel most at home when under the open sky and thus have never heard agoraphobia; and \textbf{Hobgoblins}, silghtly taller and sturdier on average than other Goblins, characterized by an affinity for rocky lands and extreme wastelands, getting as close to extremophilia as a humanoid mammal can realistically get. There is no real class distinction or caste system to keep these three subspecies apart, so interbreeding betweem them is very common.
