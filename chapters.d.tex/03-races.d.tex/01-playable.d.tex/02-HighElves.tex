\textbf{High Elves} are the dominant race of the \textbf{Kingdom of Froturn} and have a plurality in the \textbf{Empire of Neressa}, albeit their political influence expands far beyond, to the point that the Humans have adopted their religion over eight centuries ago! They have rather long lifespans, theoretically ten times that of a human \textit{(and they're also typically taller than humans, not to mention their sharp ears)}, ageing at one tenth a human's rate after reaching the age of eighteen. They descendants of those Ancestral Elves who crossed over from the Orient to colonize the Occident, making them a sister-race to the Wood Elves and Humans, who also directly evolved out of those Ancestral Elves. As an added bonus, High Elven women are deemed the most beautiful on Artograch, their fame echoing beyond the continent of Artograch, even to the Orient. The average adult High Elf is about 190 centimetres \textit{(6 feet and 3 inches)} tall, regardless of gender \textit{(albeit men to tend to be slightly taller on average)}.
