\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character has no idea how to effectively treat any wounds that are worse than a paper cut - they know nothing, other than bandaging the wounds, and maybe cauterizing it.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character can perform minor surgeries to improve the health of people with wounds - they can remove arrows and bullets, for example. If they also have the \textbf{Photomancy} feat, healing spells that cure wounds will cost only 75\% of the original mana cost.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character can perform riskier surgeries with smaller risk. If they also have the \textbf{Photomancy} feat, healing spells that cure wounds will cost only 50\% of the original mana cost.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character can perform most surgeries, even brain surgeries. If they also have the \textbf{Photomancy} feat, healing spells that cure wounds will cost only 25\% of the original mana cost.
