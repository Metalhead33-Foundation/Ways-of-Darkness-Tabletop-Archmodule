\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character can't be a virgin. \textit{(Backstory requirement)}
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None, if Basic Amorous Culture is already possed.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None, if Advanced Amorous Culture is already possed.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} When making love, the character is driven purely by their instincts - whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is subjective. One's taste might coincidentally correspond to what the character has instinctively produced, but others may want something more refined: whether that means softer and more considerate, or rougher and more aggressive, varies from partner to partner. Additionally, the character likely doesn't know much about protection, STDs, etc.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character knows how to intuit their partner's desires, and can more or less attempt to fufill them - to what degree of success, remains questioanble.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character knows the art of lovemaking, and knows how to please any partner whose desire is a technique of sorts, rather than a passive attribute of their partner. The character leaves most partners satisfied.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character has mastered the art of lovemaking to the point of effectively making their partners crazy from ecstasy during the act, constantly leaving them yearning for even more.
