\end{table}
\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} Intact hands \textit{(for an instrument)} or the character not being a mute \textit{(for vocals)}
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None, if Basic Music is already possessed.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None, if Advanced Music is already possessed.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character knows nothing about making music - they may not be tonedeaf, they may appreciate good music, but they are utterly clueless when it comes to making music. They can't play any instruments, sing out of tune, etc.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character can make acceptable quality music, and can play back existing songs with only a few mistakes. If formally trained in music, they know a lot about musical theory and can read sheet music - if not, then they can still intuit musical theory and memorize songs. Learning a new instrument is a hard thing to do.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character's musical skills are what can be expected from a typical bard - at least, one that's financially secure and isn't in the risk of running out of business.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character can compose fine songs, and can be considered a virtuoso on their instrument of choice - they also learn new instruments relatively easily. If the character has opted for vocals instead or, or in addition to instruments, they also know quite a few vocal techniques, being able to squeeze out as much as possible from their vocal chords.
