\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} None, unless your background forbids it.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character can't swim in any kind of water that is deeper than the height of their body below the neck. If they get into water that is any deeper, they'll struggle and drown. They don't even know anything about holding their breath underwater.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character can swim in and float above water that's slightly deeper than their own height, knows how to hold their breath underwater, and knows the basics about swimming techniques. They are rather slow and clumsy swimmers, but at least they aren't at the risk of drowning in shallow waters.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character is a competent swimmer. They are competent enough to take some equipment with themselves. The character can also swim through a slower-flowing river.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character can easily swim like a dolphin for hours, taking their equipment with them. However, they are still incapable of swimming in metal armour.
