\end{table}
\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character must possess Basic Riding.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None, as long as Advanced Raptoring is already possessed.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} Even the character already knows the Basics of Riding, they still can't control - or at the very least, struggle heavily with controlling - a mount that also happens to be a bipedal dinosaur/avian, such as basilisks.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character can control bipedal dinosaur/avian mounts somewhat effectively.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character controls their bipedal dinosaur or avian mount instinctively, forming a bond with their mount rather quickly.
