\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} None, unless your background forbids it.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character has no idea how to operate a ship, and lacks all the skill needed to be a competent sailor, let alone a captain.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character knows the basics of how to handle oneself on a ship, knows the enough of a typical ship's anatomy to know what's up when things happen, and knows something about rudementary navigation without a compass - they'll still likely to get lost in the open sea if misfortune falls upon the crew and fate puts the character in charge of a ship. The character makes an okay sailor, but probably a terrible captain. \textit{(Up to the GM to enforce)}
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character knows how to operate most vessels, knows a thing or two about meteorology and weather forecasting, and in case a crisis puts them in charge of a ship, they also know about watchkeeping \textit{(the assignment of sailors to specific roles on a ship to operate it continuously)}. As a sailor, the character knows what he/she is doing, but as a captain - average at best. \textit{(Up to the GM to enforce)}
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character not only knows the open sea like the palm of their own hands, but can intuit their direction, the distance of nearest land, the time of the next storm, and various other things that come handy when sailing. The character knows just about everything that can be known about operating and commanding a single vessel, though not necessarily a whole fleet. Thus, the character makes a fine captain, but not necessarily an admiral - that depends more on their general leadership skills. \textit{(Up to the GM to enforce)}
