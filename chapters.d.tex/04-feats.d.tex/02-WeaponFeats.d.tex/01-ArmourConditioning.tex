\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Light:} None, unless your background forbids it.
	\item \textbf{Medium:} None.
	\item \textbf{Heavy:} None.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character feels uncomfortable in armour, and a \Malus{50\%} to movement speed when wearing any sort of armour. When any calculations are made that involve Dexterity, wearing any sort of armour counts as a \Malus{2} to Dexterity. Magic-using characters also cannot cast spells when wearing any sort of armour.
	\item \textbf{Light:} The character feels comfortable with Light Armour \Parentheses{Gambeson and Leather Armour}, uncomfortable in anything heavier, thus incurring a \Malus{50\%} to movement speed when wearing any armour other than Gambeson and Leather Armour. When any calculations are made that involve Dexterity, wearing Medium or Heavy armour counts as a \Malus{2} to Dexterity. Magic-using characters also cannot cast spells when wearing Medium or Heavy Armour.
	\item \textbf{Medium:} The character feels comfortable with Medium Armour \Parentheses{Chainmail and Scalemail}, uncomfortable in anything heavier, thus incurring a \Malus{50\%} to movement speed when wearing Heavy Armour. When any calculations are made that involve Dexterity, wearing Heavy armour counts as a \Malus{2} to Dexterity. Magic-using characters also cannot cast spells when wearing Heavy Armour.
	\item \textbf{Heavy:} The character feels comfortable with Heavy Armour \Parentheses{Breastplates and Platemail}, incurring no malluses when wearing them. Magic-using characters \textbf{can} cast spells in any type of armour.
