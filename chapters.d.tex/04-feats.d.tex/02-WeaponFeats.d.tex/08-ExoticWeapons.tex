Exotic weapons are weapons that don't fit into any of the aforementioned categories. In fact, most characters probably wouldn't recognize any of these as weapons first, or would be largely ignorant about its attributes, whether we're talking about an existing weapon or a character's own creation.
\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} None, unless your background forbids it.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character likely doesn't even recognize the item as a weapon to begin with - but even if he/she does, the character always has a 50\% chance of inflicting damage to themselves instead of the enemy while using the weapon - and when the character doesn't inflict damage on themselves, there is a 50\% chance of missing the enemy still.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character can recognize exotic weapons, and knows a bit about them. The character doesn't inflict damage on themselves when using exotic weapons, but still has a minimum of 25\% chance of missing at each attack.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character receives no bonuses or malluses when using exotic weapons. There is no minimum chance of missing the enemy anymore, so chances of missing are purely dictated by the user's dexterity, the target's dexterity and various other factors.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character reiceves a \Bonus{50\%} to all damage done by exotic weapons.
