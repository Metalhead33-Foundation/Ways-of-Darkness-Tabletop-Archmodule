\textbf{Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Basic:} None, unless your background forbids it.
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} None.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} None.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Effects:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Untrained:} The character doesn't know how to use firearms, and even when shown, will easily forget it. Acquired knowledge lasts less than a day, and even so, the character takes at least two turns to reload a gun before being able to use it. In video game adaptations, this should also halve the gun's effective range.
	\item \textbf{Basic:} The character got the hang of using firearms, and takes just one turn to reload a gun before using it. 
	\item \textbf{Advanced:} The character reiceves a \Bonus{25\%} to all damage done by guns, and a \Bonus{25\%} to chance to hit or cause critical damage. In video game adaptations, this should also increase range.
	\item \textbf{Expert:} The character reiceves a \Bonus{50\%} to all damage done by guns, and a \Bonus{50\%} to chance to hit or cause critical damage. In video game adaptations, this should also increase range.
