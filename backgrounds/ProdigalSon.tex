\section{Prodigal Child}
You were born into a family of affluent farmers, and while your other siblings were all content with that, but not you - like the prodigal child you are, you asked for your inheritance and left early for the nearest city, wasting your inherited wealth on booze. Once out of coin though, unlike the Biblical Prodigal Son, you didn't return to your father's house - being too embarassed, you spent your last coins on enough booze to get really drunk - and the next day, you woke up as a member of a group of adventurers. The rest is history - but what is for certain, you've became an adventurer to earn back the money you wasted, so that you can finally face your father again one day.\newline
