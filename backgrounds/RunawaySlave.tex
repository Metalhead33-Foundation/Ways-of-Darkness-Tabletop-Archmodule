\section{Runaway Slave}
You are free, free to choose your fate, free to be an adventurer - but that wasn't always so. There was a time in your earlier life when you were in chains, and were someone else's property. Whether you were born into slavery or made a slave at some time in your childhood has little relevance - all that matters is, that your years in chains are behind you, and you couldn't be happier for it. While being a slave effectively forced you to develop a skill against your will, and trained your body, it also prohibited you from becoming accultured or developing any real skills fit for an adventurer.\newline
