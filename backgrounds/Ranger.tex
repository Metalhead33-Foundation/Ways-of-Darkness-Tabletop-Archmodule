\section{Ranger}
You're a ranger - a hybrid between a warrior and a druid. While druids are guardians of the forests who normally dwell at their shrines, praying, meditating, and holding masses for the masses, rangers on the other hand eschew these religious duties in favour of taking a more proactive role in projecting the interests of the Naturalist faith both at home and abroad. Rangers fight against the forces of darkness that seek to corrupt their beloved nature, but they also travel the lands to fight injustice whereever it dwells.\newline
\textbf{Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The following feats for free: Basic Swords, Basic Bows, Basic Tracking, Basic Naturalism, Advanced Literacy \Parentheses{at your native language}, Magica Naturae, Basic Aeromancy, Basic Geomancy.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Maluses:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can only pick 6 feats at the start, instead of the usual 16.
	\item The character can never learn Necromancy - as the Naturalist religion abhors the practice, considers Undead unnatural and agrees that desecrating the dead is a serious sin that should not be tolerated.
	\item Low amount of starting money.
\end{itemize}
