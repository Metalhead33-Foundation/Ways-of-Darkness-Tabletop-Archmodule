\section{Fallen Knight}
You were once a paladin of the holiest orders, spreading the Light of Titanius violently - emphasis on it being the past. Something has dragged you away from the light. Either you were turned into a vampire or a theriantrope against your will, or some event in your light made you question the dogmas of your order, and the whole idea of the Light Side - either way, you not only turned away from the Light, but fall off the other side of the horse: you turned to the Dark Side! Now your goal is no longer to help people in the need, but to increase your power, either by collecting artifacts, gaining experience and knowledge, or by earning money as a mercenary.\newline
